##thesolver-handylibs: Libraries of handy JavaScript functions (perhaps php too in the future)

###Description

*thesolver-handylibs* is just a simple library of handy JavaScript functions. It assumes jQuery (and works
in jQuery noConflict mode).

This library is owned (and copyrighted) entirely by TheSolver.us Consulting and Services and Alan Fahrner.

Although the copyright may change, for now you can use it for freely for non-commercial and commercial projects as long as you give credit (and don't charge for it).  It will remain free for those uses forever--I just haven't decided which license to ultimate use (e.g. GPL, MIT).
